# {{{ # TO-DO
# * [[x1]] Find out why the order of ffmpeg arguments breaks some files.
# * Change default DVD_TITLE to 0
# * Deprecation schedule:
#     DEPRECATED FROM | EXPECTED REMOVAL | DESCRIPTION
#   ------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------
#       1.12              1.14             Old names for settings renamed in 1.12.
#                                           output_format, plain_messages, th_height,
#                                           hpad, font_mincho
#                                          In 1.13 the new names start to be used internally.
#   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#       1.13              1.14             --end_offset  -> --end-offset
#       1.13              1.14             auto-loading ./vcs.conf (lesser version of profiles)
#                                             -C :pwd will stay
#   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#          ?               ?+1             decoder. Replaced by capturer, the syntax changes
#          ?               ?+1             --funky       -> --profile
# * Variables cleanup:
#   Variables will use a more uniform scheme, with prefixes where appropriate:
#   - INTERNAL_*: Used internally to adapt messages and the like to the input
#   - UNDFLAG_*: Undocumented flags. Used internally to keep track of undocumented modes (-Z)
#   - USR_*: Holds values of variables as set by the user, either from overrides or from the
#            command-line.
#            implementation
#   - Global variables will be capitalised while local variables will be lowercase
#   - Setting names (configuration file variables) will be case insensitive, but always
#     displayed and documented in lowercase
# * Optimisations:
#   - Reduce the number of forks/subshells
# * Portability notes
#   - 'sed -r' is not portable, works in GNU, FreeBSD equivalent -E
#   - 'grep -o' is not portable, works in GNU and FreeBSD
#      Alternatives:
#      > One match per line:
#        $ sed -n -e 's/.*\(SEARCH\).*/\1/gp
#      > Multiple matches per line: (like grep -o)
#        $ sed -n -e 's/\(SEARCH\)/\1\
#        /gp' | sed -e 's/.*\(SEARCH\).*/\1/' -e '/SEARCH/!d'
#      The p flag ONLY prints IF a substition succeeded
#   - 'expr' is not a builtin, 'expr match' is not understood in, at least, FreeBSD
#     expr operations should have equivalent bash string manipulation expressions
#   - 'egrep' is deprecated in SUS v2, 'grep -E' replaces it [[x2]]
# * UNIX filter equivalencies
#   - cut -d: -f1 === awk -F: '{print $1}' === awk '{BEGIN FS=":"}; {print $1}'
#   - grep -v pattern === sed '/pattern/d'
# }}} # TO-DO

# {{{ # Constants

# Use configuration files to modify the behaviour of the
# script. Using them allows overriding some variables (see below)
# to your liking. Only lines with a variable assignment are evaluated,
# it should follow bash syntax, note though that ';' can't be used
# currently in the variable values; e.g.:
#
#	# Sample configuration for vcs
#	user=myname		# Sign all compositions as myname
#	bg_heading=gray	# Make the heading gray
#
# There is a total of four configuration files than are loaded if the exist:
# * /etc/vcs.conf: System wide conf, least precedence
# * ~/.vcs.conf: Per-user conf, second least precedence
# * ~/.vcs/vcs.conf: Per-user conf, alternate location for more complex configs
# * ./vcs.conf: Per-dir config, most precedence (deprecated)

#   <name>_capture(in, ts, out): Capture the frame from 'in' at 'ts' to 'out'
#   <name>_dvd_capture(in, ts, out) [optional]: Same for DVDs
# Identifier functions:
#   <name>_identify(f): Extract information from 'f', fill <NAME>_ID with it
#        also fills RESULT with the same values
#   <name>_probe(file, ts): Try reaching 'ts' (test for video length)

	#   because using "label:" later makes the text too close to the border, that
	#   will be compensated in the last step.
	# * Create independent intermediate images with each row of information, the
	#   filename row is split in two images to allow changing the font, and then
	#   they're horizontally appended (and the font reset)
	# * All rows are vertically appended and cropped to regain the width in case
	#   the filename is too long
	# * The appended rows are appended to the original canvas, the resulting image
	#   contains the left row of information with the full heading width and
	#   height, and this is the *new base canvas*
	# * Draw over the new canvas the right row with annotate in one
	#   operation, the offset compensates for the extra pixel from the original
	#   base canvas. XXX: Using -annotate allows setting alignment but it breaks
	#   vertical alignment with the other rows' labels.
	# * Finally add the border that was missing from the initial width, we have
	#   now the *complete header*
	# * Add the contact sheet and append it to what we had.
	# * Start a new image and annotate it with the signature, then append it too.

  -Ij|-Ik|-Ij=fontname|-Ik=fontname
  --nonlatin            Use an alternate font in the heading for the video file
                        name. Required to display correctly file names in
                        some languages (Chinese, Japanese, Hangul,
                        Cyrillic, ...).
                        Will try to use a reasonable font. Can also be set
                        manually like:
                        $ vcs -Ij=Sazanami-Mincho-Regular file.avi
                        or
                        $ vcs -Ij=/usr/share/fonts/ttf/ttf-japanese-mincho.ttf\\
                               file.avi
                        Use \"identify -list font\" to list the available fonts
  -O|--override <arg>   Override a variable (see the homepage for more details).
                        The accepted format is 'variable=value' (can
                        also be quoted -variable=\"some value\"- and can take an
                        internal variable too -variable='\$SOME_VAR'-).

  Tweaks and workarounds:
  -Ws                   Increase length of safe measuring (try harder). Repeat
                        to increase further.
  -WS                   Scan all video, if required, to get a safe measuring.
  -Wp                   Increase safe measuring precission (i.e. halve the
                        probe stepping). Repeat to increase further.
  -WP                   Inverse of -Wp.
  -Wo                   Change ffmpeg's arguments order, might work with some
                        files that fail otherwise.
  -Wc                   Disable colour in console messages.
                        NOTE: If you have any configuration loaded before this
                             takes effect the script might still print some
                             colour. You can disable it completely by setting
                             the TERM variable to a monochrome term type, e.g.:
                             $ env TERM=vt100 vcs [options]
  Obscure options, debugging tools and workarounds:
  -R <file>
  --randomsource <file> Use the provided file as a source for \"random\" values:
                        they won't be random anymore, so two runs with the same
                        source and same arguments will produce the same output
                        in modes which use randomisation (e.g. the
                        \"photos\" and \"polaroid\" modes).
  -D                    Debug mode. Used to test features/integrity. It:
                          * Prints the input command line
                          * Sets the title to reflect the command line
                          * Does a basic test of consistency
                          * Prints all internal functions as they are called

                        These are toy output modes in which the contact sheet
                        gets a more informal look.
                        Order *IS IMPORTANT*. A bad order gets a bad result :P
                        Many of these modes are random in nature so using the
                        same mode twice will usually lead to different results.

                            Randomly rotate each image.
                        \"photoframe\": Use '-kf' or '--funky photoframe'
                            Adds a photo-like white frame to each image.
                        \"polaroidframe\": Use '-kL' or '--funky polaroidframe'
                            Adds a polaroid picture-like white frame to each
                            image.
                        \"photos\": Use '-kc' or '--funky photos'
                            Combination of rotate, photoframe and overlap.
                            Same as -kp -kr -ko.

  -i|--interval <arg>   Set the interval to arg. Units can be used
                        (case-insensitive), i.e.:
                            Seconds:      90 or 90s
                            Minutes:      3m
                            Hours:        1h
                            Combined:     1h3m90
                        Use either -i or -n.
  -n|--numcaps <arg>    Set the number of captured images to arg. Use either
                        -i or -n.
  -c|--columns <arg>    Arrange the output in 'arg' columns.
  -H|--height <arg>     Set the output (individual thumbnail) height. Width is
                        derived accordingly. Note width cannot be manually set.
  -o|--output <file>    File name of output. When ommited will be derived from
                        the input filename. Can be repeated for multiple files.
  -a|--aspect <aspect>  Aspect ratio. Accepts a floating point number or a
                        fraction.
  -f|--from <arg>       Set starting time. No caps before this. Same format
                        as -i.
  -t|--to <arg>         Set ending time. No caps beyond this. Same format
                        as -i.
  -T|--title <arg>      Add a title above the vidcaps.
  -j|--jpeg             Output in jpeg (by default output is in png).
  -j2|--jpeg2           Output in jpeg 2000
  -V|--dvd              DVD Mode.
                        In this mode the input <file>s must be the DVD
                        device(s) or ISO(s). When in DVD mode all input files
                        must be DVDs.
                        Implies -A (auto aspect ratio)
  --dvd-title <arg>     DVD title to use. Using 0 (the default) will use the
                        longest title.
  -M|--mplayer          Use Mplayer to capture$mpchosen
  -F|--ffmpeg           Use FFmpeg to capture [Default$ffchosen]

                        Features that can be disabled are:
                        * timestamps: use -dt or --disable timestamps
                        * shadows: use -ds or --disable shadows
                        * padding: use -dp or --disable padding
                          (note shadows introduce some extra padding)

                        used (use in conjunction with -S), when using this
                        -i and -n are ignored.
  -S|--stamp <arg>      Add the frame at timestamp "arg" to the set of captures.
                        Same format as -i.

$longhelp
Examples:
    Create a contact sheet with default values (vidcaps at intervals of
    $DEFAULT_INTERVAL seconds), will be saved to 'video.avi.png':
        \$ $P video.avi

    Create a sheet with vidcaps at intervals of 3 and a half minutes, save to
    'output.jpg':
        \$ $P -i 3m30 input.wmv -o output.jpg

    Create a sheet with vidcaps starting at 3 mins and ending at 18 mins,
    add an extra vidcap at 2m and another one at 19m:
        \$ $P -f 3m -t 18m -S2m -S 19m input.avi

# Bash syntax notes # {{{
# These are some notes for my own reference (or for those trying to read the script)
# regarding bash syntax nuissances.
#
# * see http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html for builtin vars
# * herestring redirection, '<<<$string', (used extensively in vcs) was introduced in bash 2.05b
# * sed s/[ ,]/ * /g <=> ${var//[ ,]/ * }      [Much faster due to not forking]
#   sed s/[ ,]/ * /  <=> ${var/[ ,]/ * }
# * bash2: declaring local empty arrays like 'local a=( )' makes bash think they're strings
#          'local -a' must be used instead
#          bash3 has no problem with this
# * bash2: 'arr+=( elem )' for array push is not supported, use 'arr=( "${arr[@]}" elem )' instead
#          += is a bash3 syntax modification, bash3.1 extended it further, arithmetic += works
#          inside let
# * bash2: [*] expands as a string while [@] expands as an array. Both have trouble with spaces
#          in elements though
# * bash3: [[ STR =~ EREGEX ]] is faster than grep/egrep (no forking)
#          bash 3.2 changed semantics vs bash 3.1
#          quoting the ERE poses a problem (newer bash will interpret as plain string, older
#          as ERE), storing the ERE in a variable or writing it unquoted solves this problem
# * bash4: |& (inherited from csh?) pipes both stdout and stderr
# * [[ A == $B ]] : $B should be quoted usually, otherwise it will be scanned as a regex
# * performance: bash loops are often slower than awk or perl
# * performance: grep + cut proved faster than an equivalent sed -r s// replacement
